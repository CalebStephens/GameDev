Advanced Features completed using course material provided and ultering for each task.

  Advanced Features: Increase spawn speed overtime until spawn interval gets to two seconds. (Otherwise it gets too fast).  
                     Sheeps run speed increase after every fifth sheep spawned.  
                     Saves players highscore between scenes.

## Game 2: Game Mechanics. 

  Advanced Features: Multiple enemies implemented with increased stats.  
                     Final two waves have a mix of enemies.  
                     If adding an enemy you eill not have to alter any code for it to appear in game.
